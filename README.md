# Ansible Lint for Rust

This is a Rust implementation of Ansible Lint, a tool for linting Ansible playbooks and roles. It aims to provide similar functionality to the original Ansible Lint tool.

## To-Do List

- [ ] Implement YAML parsing for playbooks and roles
- [ ] Create rule engine for detecting common issues and best practices
- [ ] Support for predefined profiles for rules
- [ ] Support detection of deprecated Ansible modules and parameters
- [ ] Implement custom rule configuration options
- [ ] Add support for excluding specific files or directories from linting
- [ ] Configurable via ansible lint config file
- [ ] Provide detailed documentation and usage examples

The list items above are based on the features supported by the original Ansible Lint tool. For more information, please refer to the [Ansible Lint GitHub repository](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-lint).
